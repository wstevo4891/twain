  description: My first Rails project was centered around some large
               application forms and the client wanted finished copies uploaded
               to his Dropbox account. Using Dropbox-SDK along with Wicked PDF
               and WKHTMLTOPDF, I was able to make this happen. First, I made a
               Dropbox app on the client's account for receiving files, then I
               installed the gems and pasted the app's secret keys in the
               Dropbox initializer. In the form's controller, I used Wicked PDF
               to make PDF copies of saved forms and the Dropbox API to upload
               them to the client's Dropbox app.

            gem 'wicked_pdf'\n

      header: Getting Started
      image: ''
      body: "First, you'll need a Dropbox account.\n

            **Step 1.** Get a Dropbox account.\n

            **Step 2.** Got one? Good, now go to
            https://www.dropbox.com/developers
            and sign in if needed.\n

            **Step 3.** Click on 'Create your app' in the middle of the page
            below the picture.\n

            **Step 4.** Choose 'Dropbox API' and 'App folder'. Name your app,
            and click on 'Create App'\n

            **Step 5.** On this page, you will see 'App Key' and 'App Secret'
            on the row below 'App folder name'. Click on 'show' to see the
            'App secret', now copy these keys and paste them on the appropriate
            lines in config/initializers/dropbox_config.rb.\n

            **Step 6.** Below 'App Key' and 'App Secret' you will see the
            'Oauth2' row. At the bottom of this row is 'Generated Access token'
            and a 'Generate' button beneath. Click on 'Generate', copy the key,
            and paste it between the quotes on the OAUTH2_ACCESS_TOKEN line in
            dropbox_config.rb.\n

            **WARNING:** If you're going to push this project to a public
            repository, you should assign those keys to environment variables
            ( ENV['DROPBOX_SECRET_KEY'] ). I like using the 'dotenv-rails' gem
            for setting these up. You have a .env.local file where your
            environment variables are defined for development, and you include
            that file in your .gitignore. Now you can show everyone your awesome
            code without giving them the access keys to mess around with your
            Dropbox app.\n

            If you deploy to Heroku, you'll assign your environment variables
            manually like so:\n

            $ heroku config:set DROPBOX_SECRET_KEY='...'"

    - header: Configuring Your PDFs
      image: ''
      body: "**Step 7.** Let's say you have a model called Order, and you want
            a PDF of each completed order sent to your Dropbox account. For this
            to work, you'll need a pdf layout and a pdf view of your form, AND
            you'll need to allow pdf mime_types.\n

            First, we'll set the mime_type. Add this line to
            /config/initializers/mime_types.rb:\n

            ```ruby\n
            # Mime::Type.register 'application/pdf', :pdf\n
            ```\n

            Next, create a new file in your /views/layouts folder called
            pdf.html.erb.  This file will be a copy of your application.html.erb
            with a few differences.\n

            Wicked PDF requires special tags to load the asset pipeline and
            images. In the head of pdf.html.erb, swap out the javscript and
            stylesheet erb tags with these:\n

            ```ruby\n
            <%= wicked_pdf_stylesheet_link_tag 'application', media: 'all', 'data-turbolinks-track' => true %>\n
            <%= wicked_pdf_javascript_include_tag 'application', 'data-turbolinks-track' => true %>\n
            ```\n

            If you have any images (like a company logo) in the layout, use the
            wicked_pdf_image_tag to render them:\n

            ```ruby\n
            <%= wicked_pdf_image_tag('Logo.jpg') %>\n
            ```\n

            Next, create a new file in /views/orders called edit.pdf.erb. Copy
            the contents of your form here and top it with an h1 to display the
            name of the form."
    -
      header: Controller Logic
      image: ''
      body: "**Step 8.** Lastly, we need to write some controller methods. In
            Orders_Controller.rb you'll start with a few methods that save the
            order as a PDF in the /tmp directory.\n

            ```ruby\n
            def filename\n
            \_\_@order.user_id.to_s + '_' + @order.business\n
            end\n

            def save_path\n
            \_\_Rails.root.join('tmp',\"#{filename}.order.pdf\")\n
            end\n
            ```\n

            You'll want each pdf to have a unique name. Here, I've added the
            user_id to the name of the user's business (which is a required
            field in the form), but you can make it whatever you like.\n

            The save_path method simply defines a save path in the /tmp
            directory for the pdf to sit while it waits to be uploaded. After
            the upload, we'll delete this temporary file to keep our app clean.\n

            ```ruby\n
            def save_as_pdf\n
            \_\_pdf = render_to_string pdf: 'order.pdf',\n
            \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_layout: 'pdf.html.erb',\n
            \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_template: 'orders/edit.pdf.erb',\n
            \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_encoding: 'UTF-8',\n
            \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_wkhtmltopdf: 'bin/wkhtmltopdf',\n
            \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_page_height: '20in',\n
            \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_page_width: '12em'\n
            \_\_File.open(save_path, 'wb') do |file|\n
            \_\_\_\_file << pdf\n
            \_\_end\n
            end\n
            ```\n

            This method uses wicked_pdf options to designate 'pdf.html.erb' as our
            layout, 'edit.pdf.erb' as the view, the path to our html/pdf converter,
            wkhtmltopdf, in the /bin folder, and the page dimensions (you should
            play around with these to get them just right)."
    -
      header: Using The Dropbox API
      image: ''
      body: "Now we're ready for a method that uses the Dropbox API:\n

            ```ruby\n
            def dropbox_upload(bool)\n
            \_\_save_as_pdf\n
            \_\_file = open(save_path)\n
            \_\_client = DropboxClient.new(OAUTH2_ACCESS_TOKEN)\n
            \_\_response = client.put_file(filename + '.order.pdf', file, overwrite=bool)\n
            \_\_File.delete(save_path)\n
            end\n
            ```\n

            This method will be called in 'create' and 'update.' First it save the
            file as a pdf in /tmp, then it sets the variable 'file' to that save
            path. The variable 'client' is set to a new DropboxClient instance and
            passes in your OAUTH access token. The response calls the 'put_file'
            (upload) method on the client variable and defines the name of the file
            that will be uploaded.  If you want the files to go to a specifc folder
            in your Dropbox app, just put a string of that folder name before +
            filename. Lastly, the pdf in /tmp is deleted.\n

            You may have noticed 'overwrite=bool'. If you want to overwrite a file
            in Dropbox with a similar name, which you want to do on update, you call
            the method with 'true' as its parameter. I set the parameter to 'false'
            on create.\n

            Let's see how this looks in 'create' and 'update'.\n

            **NOTE:** I've set up orders to belong_to users, so I'm using
            @user.create_order for the create method. I'm also using Devise so I can
            use its current_user method.\n

            ```ruby\n
            def create\n
            \_\_@order = @user.create_order(order_params)\n

            \_\_respond_to do |format|\n
            \_\_\_\_if @order.save\n
            \_\_\_\_\_\_dropbox_upload(false)\n
            \_\_\_\_\_\_format.html { redirect_to current_user, notice: 'Your order has been processed' }\n
            \_\_\_\_\_\_format.json { render :show, status: :created, location: @order }\n
            \_\_\_\_else\n
            \_\_\_\_\_\_format.html { render :new }\n
            \_\_\_\_\_\_'format.json { render json: @order.errors, status: :unprocessable_entity }'\n
            \_\_\_\_end\n
            \_\_end\n
            end\n

            def update\n
            \_\_respond_to do |format|\n
            \_\_\_\_if @order.update(order_params)\n
            \_\_\_\_\_\_dropbox_upload(true)\n
            \_\_\_\_\_\_'format.html { redirect_to current_user, notice: 'Order was successfully updated' }'\n
            \_\_\_\_\_\_'format.json { render :show, status: :ok, location: @order }'\n
            \_\_\_\_else\n
            \_\_\_\_\_\_format.html { render :edit }\n
            \_\_\_\_\_\_'format.json { render json: @order.errors, status: :unprocessable_entity }'\n
            \_\_\_\_end\n
            \_\_end\n
            end\n
            ```\n

            Now you're all set!  When a user saves an order you will receive a pdf
            copy in your Dropbox app.  If the pdf looks wonky, you may need to
            fiddle with the CSS related to your pdf.html.erb layout file and the
            page dimensions in the save_as_pdf method.  Make SURE that you set
            enabled pdfs in your mime_types or you won't get a pdf at all.\n

            Thanks for reading and happy uploading!"

  description: My on-going side project to recreate Netflix's front end, Bolt
               Network, has some nifty do-dads, one being that all CRUD actions
               in the Genres index are executed with AJAX. If you're not
               familiar, AJAX stands for "Asynchronous JavaScript and XML." In
               human-speak, that means you can click on things that interact
               with the server without having to navigate somewhere or refresh
               the web page.
  sections:
    -
      header: Why AJAX Helps
      image: ''
      body: In *Agile Web Development with Rails 4*, Sam Ruby says AJAX is for
            "making browsers suck less." Long before I decided to take Bolt Network
            from its humble roots as a twenty-minute exercise on Codecademy, I
            learned how to "AJAX-ify" the delete action in a Rails index table.
            Instead of having to wait on a page refresh when you delete something,
            it just disappears in a puff of jQuery...and you can get on with your
            task of deleting things. In a large app with hundreds or
            thousands of records, whoever has to clean house when a big batch of
            that data needs to become trash will not be sane at the end of the day
            if that delete button doesn't use AJAX.
    -
      header: Make Your Delete Button Remote
      image: ''
      body: "Fortunately, running the destroy action through AJAX is easy. All you do
            to the Delete link is add `remote':' true`:\n

            ```ruby\n
            <%= link_to 'Delete', genre, method: :delete, data: { confirm: 'Are you sure?' }, remote: true, class: 'btn delete_genre' %>\n
            ```\n

            This code tells Rails to process the delete action asynchronously. Note
            that it has the class `delete_genre`. That will be important later. Now
            let's have a look at the controller method:\n

            ```ruby\n
            def destroy\n
            \_\_@genre.destroy\n
            \_\_respond_to do |format|\n
            \_\_\_\_format.html { render :index, notice: 'Genre was deleted' }\n
            \_\_\_\_format.json { head :no_content }\n
            \_\_\_\_format.js\n
            \_\_end\n
            end\n
            ```\n

            The only differences between this code and a scaffolded destroy method
            is A) the HTML renders the :index page (the same page you're already on)
            and B) `format.js` tells Rails to respond to the request with
            JavaScript. That JS goes in a little file called destroy.js.erb:\n

            ```java_script\n
            $('.delete_genre').bind('ajax:success', function() {\n
            \_\_$(this).closest('tr').fadeOut('slow');\n
            });\n
            ```\n

            When a user (hopefully an admin) clicks on the button with class
            delete_genre, a successful AJAX call will trigger the table row
            nearest the button to fade out slowly. It's gone, and if you refresh the
            page it will still be gone. Now the poor sap assigned to delete all
            those expired records won't show up at the office with a shotgun
            tomorrow.\n

            Ajaxifying the delete action is not just helpful, it's also relatively
            harmless. The thing to keep in mind is that the browser won't actually
            reflect changes to the database until it reloads. So if I delete the
            Sci-Fi genre from Bolt Network using AJAX, \"Sci-Fi\" will remain in the
            \"browse\" drop-down menu because those links are loaded with an each loop
            that grabs all Genre names from the database (@genres = Genre.all) when
            the page loads. Sci-Fi will ONLY disappear from the browse menu after
            the browser refreshes and reloads all the genre names from the database.
            I say \"relatively harmless\" because as an admin, your job is to update
            the records, not to have a seamless, responsive END-USER experience.
            The end-users will see the changes you make regardless of whether you
            refreshed your browser. I guess the point I'm trying to make here is
            that it's ok for *admin* functions to use AJAX this way, but you don't
            want *user* functions to disregard REST guidelines. Keep the users on
            the yellow-brick REST path, safe within its rubber wall confines."
    -
      header: AJAX-ify The Create Method
      image: ''
      body: "Right! With all that out of the way, let me show you how to AJAX-ify all
            the CRUD actions in a table. Let's start by jumping to the polar
            opposite of Destroy: Create!\n

            Here's the controller method:\n

            ```ruby\n
            def create\n
            \_\_@genre = Genre.new(genre_params)\n

            \_\_respond_to do |format|\n
            \_\_\_\_if @genre.save\n
            \_\_\_\_\_\_format.html { render :index, notice: 'Genre was successfully created'}\n
            \_\_\_\_\_\_format.json { render :index, status: :created, location: @genre}\n
            \_\_\_\_\_\_format.js\n
            \_\_\_\_else\n
            \_\_\_\_\_\_format.html { render :new }\n
            \_\_\_\_\_\_format.json { render json: @genre.errors, status: :unprocessable_entity }\n
            \_\_\_\_end\n
            \_\_end\n
            end\n
            ```\n

            Nothing new here, all you do is `render :index` instead of redirecting
            and add that `format.js`. We'll have a look at create.js.erb in a bit.
            First I want you to see the index view and the genre and form partials:\n

            views/genres/index.html.erb\n

            ```erb\n

            \_\_</div>\n
            \_\_<br>\n

            ```\n

            views/genres/_genre.html.erb\n

            \_\_<tr class=\"new-genre\">\n
            \_\_\_\_<td>New Genre</td>\n
            \_\_\_\_<div class=\"form-group\">\n
            \_\_\_\_\_\_<td><%= f.label :name %></td>\n
            \_\_\_\_\_\_<td><%= f.text_field :name, class: 'form-control' %></td>\n
            \_\_\_\_</div>\n
            \_\_\_\_<td>\n
            \_\_\_\_\_\_<%= f.submit 'Add', class: 'btn' %>\n
            \_\_\_\_</td>\n
            \_\_</tr>\n

            \_\_<% if @genre.errors.any? %>\n
            \_\_\_\_<div id=\"error_explanation\">\n
            \_\_\_\_\_\_<h2><%= pluralize(@genre.errors.count, 'error') %> prohibited this movie from being saved:</h2>\n

            \_\_\_\_\_\_<ul>\n
            \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_<% @genre.errors.full_messages.each do |message| %>\n
            \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_<li><%= message %></li>\n
            \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_<% end %>\n
            \_\_\_\_\_\_</ul>\n
            \_\_\_\_</div>\n
            \_\_<% end %>\n
            <% end %>\n
            ```\n

            The genres are listed in a striped table with an inline form to add a
            new one at the bottom. Notice that `remote: true` finds itself in the
            'form_for' tag's options this time. That means the entire form will be
            submitted asynchronously through AJAX. Ready to see what create.js.erb
            does?\n

            views/genres/create.js.erb\n

            ```java_script\n
            $('tbody tr:last').before(<%= j render(@genre) %>).fadeIn('slow');\n
            ```\n

            It turns out that AJAX is a pretty simple thing (at least at this
            point). The jQuery targets the last row in the table body, which is the
            form, and slides in the new record \"before\" it. The
            `<%= j render() %>` tag is extremely useful for this kind of thing.
            It also goes by the name of `escape_javascript`, but `j render` is less
            to type. Since this code is running through the controller's create
            method, the instance variable, @genre, is equal to Genre.new: it creates
            a new genre entry."
    -
      header: AJAX-ifying Edit and Update
      image: ''
      body: "Now we leave the safe confines of Create and Destroy, and enter the far
            trickier territory of Edit and Update. I wanted the edit action to be an
            inline form, like create, that appears when you click on the \"Edit\"
            link, but this proved far more difficult than I imagined.\n

            Edit.js.erb seemed simple enough, just swap out the nearest table row to
            the clicked link with an edit partial:\n

            views/genres.edit.js.erb\n

            ```java_script\n
            $('tr#<%= dom_id(@genre) %>').replaceWith('<%= j render('edit') %>');\n
            ```\n

            Well, I ended up using the neat `dom_id` method to locate the exact row
            to swap out. Remember, this goes through the Edit action where
            `@genre = Genre.find(params[:id])`. The jQuery finds the table row with
            the same id as the rendered genre partial on whose edit button I
            clicked, which is helped by the fact that each partial has a unique id:
            `<tr id=\"genre_<%= genre.id %>\">`\n

            So there you go, swap out that row with an edit partial that contains a
            table row wrapped in a form.\n

            WRONG!\n

            In Ye Olde Book of HTML it hath been decreed that thou shalt not wrap a
            table row with a form, lest ye call upon thyself the wrath of the
            internet gods...and rabbits with pointy teeth.\n

            To put it simply, that form-wrapped table row rendered hideously. It
            didn't look at all like what I wanted: a simple inline form on a row.
            The solution: put the form in a table cell `<td></td>`. It looks ugly
            and squished to the left...unless you stretch that cell to the length of
            the table:\n

            views/genres/_edit.html.erb\n

            ```erb\n
            <tr id=\"edit-genre\">\n
            \_\_<td colspan=12>\n
            \_\_\_\_<%= form_for(@genre, html: { class: 'form-inline' }, remote: true) do |f| %>\n
            \_\_\_\_\_\_<div class=\"form-group col-sm-6\">\n
            \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_<%= f.label 'Edit' %>\n
            \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_<%= f.label :name %>\n
            \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_<%= f.text_field :name, class: 'form-control', placeholder: @genre.name %>\n
            \_\_\_\_\_\_</div>\n
            \_\_\_\_\_\_<%= f.submit 'Save', class: 'btn' %>\n
            \_\_\_\_<% end %>\n
            \_\_</td>\n
            </tr>\n
            ```\n

            Success! Business!\n

            All that remained was update.js.erb, which was a mirror image of
            edit.js.erb:\n

            views/genres/update.js.erb\n

            ```java_script\n
            $('#edit-genre').replaceWith('<%= j render(@genre) %>');\n
            ```\n

            It grabs the edit form by its id and swaps it with the genre partial of
            that particular record. Done!\n

            If you'd like to see this in action, head over to 'WORK', click on the
            Bolt Network image, and click the Visit Website button.\n

            Happy Ajaxing!"

  description: "After building some demo apps in Angular and being amazed by the
               live reloading feature of Grunt and Gulp, I desperately wanted
               to do this in Rails development. Two articles, multiple Github
               docs, and several hours of trial and error later, I got the damn
               thing to work! It's a somewhat tricky setup and requires an
               additional console window to the one running your rails server,
               but the fact that I will never again have to wait 30 - 50
               seconds to see the changes to my CSS3 animations puts a big
               stupid grin on my face."
  sections:
    -
      header: Gems
      image: ''
      body: "\"So...,\" you might ask, \"what gems am I installing?\" Glad you
            asked, reader.\n

            ```ruby\n
            group :development do\n
            \_\_gem 'guard', require':' false\n
            \_\_gem 'guard-livereload', require':' false\n
            \_\_gem 'rack-livereload'\n
            \_\_gem 'rb-fsevent', require':' false\n
            \_\_gem 'rack-mini-profiler'\n
            end\n
            ```\n

            [Guard](https://github.com/guard/guard) is a command line tool used to
            automate tasks, specifically to \"avoid mundane, repetitive actions and
            commands such as \"relaunching\" tools after changing source files or
            configurations.\" Sounds right up our alley.  To get live reloading
            working with Guard, we add the \"guard-livereload\" plugin and
            \"rack-livereload\". Bundle 'rb-fsevent' if you're using a Mac. Lastly, I
            added the wonderful 'rack-mini-profiler' because we're doing this thing
            we're doing for Performance!  Mini-profiler adds a little tab to the top
            left of the browser window that lets you know how long the last request
            took.  It expands on click to give the timing on specific actions in the
            loading process. It is something you should always have in development."
    -
      header: Making a Guardfile
      image: ''
      body: "Right, so you bundle installed the gems, now you need to create a
            Guardfile:\n

            $ guard init livereload\n

            This command will create a Guardfile with live-reload settings. TL;DR
            the settings use regex to watch for changes in asset and view files.
            After launching a rails server, you need another console window to
            launch Guard from your app's root directory:\n

            $ guard -P livereload  ( add --debug to get more detailed logs )\n

            Now, whenever you change your CSS, JavaScript, or images, Guard will
            detect it and tell the browser to reload."
    -
      header: Setting Up Your CSS
      image: ''
      body: "Of course, it depends on how you've set up the asset pipeline to handle
            your CSS.  In my case, I'm being old school and using
            \"//= require foobar\" for each stylesheet in application.css. There's a
            cleaner setup for Sass in Rails (described
            [here](http://www.mattboldt.com/organizing-css-and-sass-rails/)), but
            the advantage of using Sprockets' //= require is that the page only has
            to reload that one file instead of the entire compiled stylesheet."
    -
      header: Chrome LiveReload
      image: ''
      body: "One last thing: I have not been able to make this work on Chrome without
            the [Chrome LiveReload Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei?hl=en).
            When it's installed, you'll see the LiveReload icon in the upper-right
            of your screen. If the dot in the middle is solid, Guard is connected to
            the browser and vice versa. If the dot is empty, just click it to
            connect.\n

            Have a great time live-reloading!"
