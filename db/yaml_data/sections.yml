**Step 7.** Let's say you have a model called Order, and you want
a PDF of each completed order sent to your Dropbox account. For this
to work, you'll need a pdf layout and a pdf view of your form, AND
you'll need to allow pdf mime_types.

First, we'll set the mime_type. Add this line to
/config/initializers/mime_types.rb:

First, we'll set the mime_type. Add this line to
/config/initializers/mime_types.rb:

```ruby
# Mime::Type.register 'application/pdf', :pdf
```

Next, create a new file in your /views/layouts folder called
pdf.html.erb.  This file will be a copy of your application.html.erb
with a few differences.

Wicked PDF requires special tags to load the asset pipeline and
images. In the head of pdf.html.erb, swap out the javscript and
stylesheet erb tags with these:

```ruby
<%= wicked_pdf_stylesheet_link_tag 'application', media: 'all', 'data-turbolinks-track' => true %>
<%= wicked_pdf_javascript_include_tag 'application', 'data-turbolinks-track' => true %>
```

If you have any images (like a company logo) in the layout, use the
wicked_pdf_image_tag to render them:

```ruby
<%= wicked_pdf_image_tag('Logo.jpg') %>
```

Next, create a new file in /views/orders called edit.pdf.erb. Copy
the contents of your form here and top it with an h1 to display the
name of the form.
